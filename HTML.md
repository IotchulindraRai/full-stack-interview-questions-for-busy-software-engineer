# HTML Interview Questions

### Q1. What is HTML?

### Q2. What are the basic elements of HTML?

This means that XHTML is stricter and requires all elements to be properly closed, while HTML allows for some flexibility in this regard.

The alt text should describe the content of the image in a concise and meaningful way.
