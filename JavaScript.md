# JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is JavaScript?

##### JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is often used in web development to create interactive and dynamic websites. It is an object-oriented language that supports a wide range of features such as functions, arrays, objects, and loops.

### 2. What is the difference between == and === operators in JavaScript?

##### The '==' operator compares two values for equality, but it does not take into account their data types. On the other hand, the '===' operator compares two values for equality and also checks their data types.

```javascript
console.log(1 == '1');  // true
console.log(1 === '1');  // false
```

### 3. What are closures in JavaScript?

##### Closures are functions that have access to the variables defined in their outer function, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are often used to create private variables in JavaScript.

```javascript

function outerFunction() {
  var outerVariable = 'I am outer';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

var innerFunctionRef = outerFunction();
innerFunctionRef();  // Output: I am outer
```

### 4. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

##### In JavaScript, 'null' is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value, whereas 'undefined' is a value that represents the absence of any value.

```javascript
var variable1;  // undefined
var variable2 = null;  // null
```
### 5. What is the 'this' keyword in JavaScript?

##### The 'this' keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is currently executing the code. The value of 'this' can change depending on how a function is called.

```javascript
var person = {
  firstName: 'Md. Rumon',
  lastName: 'Khan',
  fullName: function() {
    console.log(this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
  }
};

person.fullName();  // Output: Md. Rumon Khan
```
### 6. What is a callback function in JavaScript?

##### A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called when the parent function has finished executing. Callback functions are often used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  // Simulate an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(function() {
    var data = { name: 'Rumon', age: 21 };
    callback(data);
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData(function(data) {
  console.log(data);  // Output: { name: 'Rumon', age: 21 }
});
```
### 7. What is the difference between let and var in JavaScript?

##### The 'let' keyword was introduced in ES6 and is used to declare variables with block scope. On the other hand, the 'var' keyword is used to declare variables with function scope.

```javascript 
if (true) {
  var variable1 = 'I am var';
  let variable2 = 'I am let';
}

console.log(variable1);  // Output: I am var
console.log(variable2);  // Throws ReferenceError: variable2 is not defined
```
### 8. What is the use of the 'use strict' directive in JavaScript?

##### The 'use strict' directive is used to enforce stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript. When used, it enables a stricter mode of execution and disallows certain actions that are allowed in non-strict mode.

```javascript
'use strict';

x = 3.14;  // Throws ReferenceError
```
