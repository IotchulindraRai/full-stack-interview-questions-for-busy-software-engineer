## HTML Interview Questions

### Q1. What is HTML?

##### HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications.

### Q2. What are the basic elements of HTML?

##### The basic elements of HTML are:

The alt text should describe the content of the image in a concise and meaningful way.
